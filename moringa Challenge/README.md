# Coding Challenges and Solutions

This document outlines a series of coding challenges along with their solutions in Python. The challenges range from array manipulation, digit sums, to generating strings with specific properties.

## Challenge 1: Equal Sum of Digits

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `A` consisting of `N` integers, return the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. If no two numbers have digits that add up to the same sum, the function should return -1.
